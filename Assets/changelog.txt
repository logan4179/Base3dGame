v_12/13/21
	* Working on:
		* Selection of inventory items
		* Added "map" as 3rd pause menu button.


* Implemented MenuObject.cs for instance-based menu controll.
* Changed G.cs delegates/events to UnityEvents.
* Fixed issues with gun firing full auto logic
* Implemented both controller and mouse control of gun aiming and firing

Since last push-------------
* Big and minor cleanups to code
* Changed masking system to be more reliable by grabbing from Unity with LayerMask.GetMask("<layer name>"); instead of calculating manually
* Moved level2 and level3 logic coroutines from the enemy instances to the enemy manager, which will presumably be more efficient.
* Implemented different method of checking relative positioning for living entities.
* Took away some of the sword fighting implementations that weren't needed from my previous codebase.
